### Quash: A Simple Shell Implementation

### Project Overviews
Quash (Quick Shell) is a simple command-line shell that replicates the core functionalities of popular UNIX shells like sh, bash, csh, and tcsh. The goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of command-line interfaces (CLI), process forking, background processes, signal handling, I/O redirection, and piping.



### This shell was implemented in multiple tasks to incrementally add features:
Task 1: Basic built-in commands (cd, pwd, echo, env, setenv, exit). Task 2: Process creation and forking for external commands. Task 3: Background process support using &. Task 4: Signal handling for Ctrl-C to avoid quitting the shell. Task 5: Timer to kill long-running foreground processes after 10 seconds. Task 6: I/O redirection with > and < and piping with |.
### How to Use the Shell
Compile the shell: make

Run the shell: ./shell

Exit the shell by typing: exit

### Built-in Commands
cd : Change the current working directory. pwd: Print the current working directory. echo : Print a message or environment variables (e.g., echo $PATH). env: Display the list of environment variables. setenv : Set a new environment variable. exit: Exit the shell.
### Features Implemented
Task 1: Built-in Commands We implemented essential built-in commands such as cd, pwd, echo, env, setenv, and exit. We tokenized user input to separate commands from arguments.
Task 2: Process Forking We used fork() to create child processes and execvp() to execute external commands. We handled errors for non-existent commands.
Task 3: Background Processes We implemented background process support using &. The shell returns immediately to the prompt when a command is run in the background.
Task 4: Signal Handling We implemented SIGINT (Ctrl-C) handling to prevent the shell from exiting. The shell catches Ctrl-C and returns to the prompt without quitting.
Task 5: Killing Long-Running Processes We used alarm() to set a 10-second timeout for foreground processes. If a process exceeds the timeout, it is killed using kill().
Task 6: I/O Redirection and Piping I/O Redirection:
'>' redirects command output to a file. Example: cat shell.c > output.txt

'<' redirects a file as input to a command. Example: more < shell.c

Piping:

Pipes the output of one command as input to another. Example: cat testData | grep "this"


### Design Choices

Tokenization: We used strtok() to split user input into tokens. Built-in Command Handling: we Checked if the user command was built-in before attempting to fork a new process. Signal Handling: We implemented custom signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGALRM. Redirection & Piping: We used dup2() to redirect input/output streams and pipe() for piping between processes.

### Known Limitations and Future Improvements
Command History: Currently, the shell does not store or display command history. Job Control: Commands like fg, bg, and jobs are not implemented. Enhanced Piping: Multiple piping (cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3) could be added.
